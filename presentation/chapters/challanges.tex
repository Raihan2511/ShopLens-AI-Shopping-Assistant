\begin{frame}{Challenges}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Finding a good dataset that includes both images and meaningful textual descriptions was a major challenge.
      \item Initially, we used the \textbf{Amazon UK Products Dataset 2023 (2.2M products)} to seed our inventory.
      \item However, the fashion product descriptions in this dataset were often not meaningful.
      \item We then attempted to scrape Amazon data manually, but scraping was very slow and triggered repeated Cloudflare human checks (likely due to not using a proxy).
      \item Finally, we settled on the dataset mentioned earlier that offered high-quality image-text pairs.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}{Limitations}
  While our project achieved its core objectives, some limitations remain:

  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Small Object Retrieval Challenges}
      \item \textbf{Lack of Multimodal Retrieval}
      \item \textbf{Fixed Inventory Limitation}
      \item \textbf{Limited Personalization}
      \item \textbf{Streamlit Deployment Constraints}
  \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
