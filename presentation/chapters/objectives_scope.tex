\begin{frame}{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> Develop an application to \textbf{assist users} in finding fashion items \textbf{easily and efficiently}.
    \item<2-> Implement an \textbf{AI-powered text-based search system} allowing \textbf{natural language queries}.
    \item<3-> Design and integrate an \textbf{image-based product search} for retrieving \textbf{visually similar fashion products}.
    \item<4-> Leverage \textbf{object detection} and \textbf{visual similarity algorithms} specialized for fashion items.
\end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0.75em}
    \item<1-> \textbf{Text and image-based search} for fashion items.
    \item<2-> A unified chatbot interface for \textbf{natural language queries} and \textbf{image uploads}.
    \item<3-> Implementation of \textbf{object detection} to find the different types of clothings of a person is wearing and ability to select one of them for searching.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Scope}
  \begin{block}{What This Project Does Not Cover}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item<1-> Our system currently supports independent image-based and text-based retrieval. However, it cannot perform \textbf{multimodal queries} that combine both inputs.
      \item<2-> Our system does not yet incorporate user-specific preferences, browsing history, or style profiles,
      \item<3-> The current \textbf{Streamlit-based} prototype, while functional, may not scale optimally for very large product inventories or concurrent user loads without transitioning to a more robust backend infrastructure.
    \end{itemize}
